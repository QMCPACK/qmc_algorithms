# QMC Algorithms
Scripts and supporting material to validate QMC codes.

Primarily for QMCPACK (http://qmcpack.org/ ), but could be used more generally useful.

Directories:
* [LongRange](LongRange/Readme.md) - Ewald summation on a lattice for long range (Coulomb) potentials.
* [StochasticReconfiguration](StochasticReconfiguration/Readme.md) - Stochastic reconfiguration for fixed population diffusion Monte Carlo.
* [Variational](Variational/Readme.md) - Demonstration of variational principle for energy of hydrogen and helium atoms.
* [Wavefunctions](Wavefunctions/Readme.md) - Various functional forms for wavefunctions.
* [Diffusion](Diffusion/Readme.md) - Diffusion Monte Carlo
* [Estimators](Estimators/Readme.md) - Quantities of interest to compute.

Many of these notebooks use Sympy for symbolic expressions.  The notebook [Intro to Sympy](Intro%20to%20Sympy.ipynb) contains a short guide to Sympy as used in these notebooks.
