# QMC Algorithms
Scripts and supporting material to validate QMC codes.

Primarily for QMCPACK (http://qmcpack.org/ ), but could be used more generally useful.

Directories:
* LongRange - Ewald summation on a lattice for long range (Coulomb) potentials.
* StochasticReconfiguration - Stochastic reconfiguration for fixed population diffusion Monte Carlo.
* Variational - Demonstration of variational principle for energy of hydrogen and helium atoms.
* Wavefunctions - Various functional forms for wavefunctions.

Many of these notebooks use Sympy for symbolic expressions.  The notebook [Intro to Sympy](Intro%20to%20Sympy.ipynb) contains a a short guide to Sympy as used in these notebooks.
